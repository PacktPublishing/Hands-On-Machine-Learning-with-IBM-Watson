**Leverage IBM Watson to implement machine learning techniques and algorithms using Python**

## What is this book about?
IBM Cloud is a collection of cloud computing services for data analytics using machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). This book is a complete guide to help you become well versed with machine learning on the IBM Cloud using Python. 

Hands-On Machine Learning with IBM Watson starts with supervised and unsupervised machine learning concepts, in addition to providing you with an overview of IBM Cloud and Watson Machine Learning. You'll gain insights into running various techniques, such as K-means clustering, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and time series prediction in IBM Cloud with real-world examples. The book will then help you delve into creating a Spark pipeline in Watson Studio. You will also be guided through deep learning and neural network principles on the IBM Cloud using TensorFlow. With the help of NLP techniques, you can then brush up on building a chatbot. In later chapters, you will cover three powerful case studies, including the facial expression classification platform, the automated classification of lithofacies, and the multi-biometric identity authentication platform, helping you to become well versed with these methodologies.

By the end of this book, you will be ready to build efficient machine learning solutions on the IBM Cloud and draw insights from the data at hand using real-world examples.

This book covers the following exciting features:

* Implement data science and machine learning techniques to draw insights from real-world data
* Understand what IBM Cloud platform can help you to implement cognitive insights within applications
* Understand the role of data representation and feature extraction in any machine learning system
